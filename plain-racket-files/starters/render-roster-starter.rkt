; Problem:
; 
; You are running a dodgeball tournament and are given a list of all
; of the players in a particular game as well as their team numbers.  
; You need to build a game roster like the one shown below. We've given
; you some constants and data definitions for Player, ListOfPlayer 
; and ListOfString to work with. 
; 
; While you're working on these problems, make sure to keep your 
; helper rules in mind and use helper functions when necessary.
; 
; .
; 


(require 2htdp/image)

;; Constants
;; ---------

(define CELL-WIDTH 200)
(define CELL-HEIGHT 30)

(define TEXT-SIZE 20)
(define TEXT-COLOR "black")

;; Data Definitions
;; ----------------

(define-struct player (name team))
;; Player is (make-player String Natural[1,2])
;; interp. a dodgeball player. 
;;   (make-player s t) represents the player named s 
;;   who plays on team t
;; 
(define P0 (make-player "Samael" 1))
(define P1 (make-player "Georgia" 2))

#;
(define (fn-for-player p)
  (... (player-name p)
       (player-team p)))


;; ListOfPlayer is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons Player ListOfPlayer)
;; interp.  A list of players.
(define LOP0 empty)                     ;; no players
(define LOP2 (cons P0 (cons P1 empty))) ;; two players

#;
(define (fn-for-lop lop)
  (cond [(empty? lop) (...)]
        [else
         (... (fn-for-player (first lop))
              (fn-for-lop (rest lop)))]))


;; ListOfString is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons String ListOfString)
;; interp. a list of strings
(define LOS0 empty)
(define LOS2 (cons "Samael" (cons "Georgia" empty)))

#;
(define (fn-for-los los)
  (cond [(empty? los) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first los)
              (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))

;; Functions
;; ---------

; PROBLEM 1: 
; 
; Design a function called select-players that consumes a list 
; of players and a team t (Natural[1,2]) and produces a list of 
; players that are on team t.




; PROBLEM 2:  
; 
; Complete the design of render-roster. We've started you off with 
; the signature, purpose, stub and examples. You'll need to use
; the function that you designed in Problem 1.
; 
; Note that we've also given you a full function design for render-los
; and its helper, render-cell. You will need to use these functions
; when solving this problem.


;; ListOfPlayer -> Image
;; Render a game roster from the given list of players
