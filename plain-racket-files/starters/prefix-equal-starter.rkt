; PROBLEM: design a function that consumes two lists of strings and produces true
; if the first list is a prefix of the second. Prefix means that the elements of
; the first list match the elements of the second list 1 for 1, and the second list
; is at least as long as the first.
; 
; For reference, the ListOfString data definition is provided below.

;; =================
;; Data Definitions:

;; ListOfString is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons String ListOfString)
;; interp. a list of strings

(define LS0 empty)
(define LS1 (cons "a" empty))
(define LS2 (cons "a" (cons "b" empty)))
(define LS3 (cons "c" (cons "b" (cons "a" empty))))

#;
(define (fn-for-los los)
  (cond [(empty? los) (...)]
        [else 
         (... (first los)
              (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))
