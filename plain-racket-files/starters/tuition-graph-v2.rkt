; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Eva is trying to decide where to go to university. One important factor for her is 
; tuition costs. Eva is a visual thinker, and has taken Systematic Program Design, 
; so she decides to design a program that will help her visualize the costs at 
; different schools. She decides to start simply, knowing she can revise her design
; later.
; 
; The information she has so far is the names of some schools as well as their 
; international student tuition costs. She would like to be able to represent that
; information in bar charts like this one:
; 
; 
;         .
;         
; (A) Design data definitions to represent the information Eva has.
; (B) Design a function that consumes information about schools and their
;     tuition and produces a bar chart.
; (C) Design a function that consumes information about schools and produces
;     the school with the lowest international student tuition.
