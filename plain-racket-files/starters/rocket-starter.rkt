;; =================
;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends 
; 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from 
; 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
; 
; Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent. 
; Call it RocketDescent.
; 


;; =================
;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM B:
; 
; Design a function that will output the rocket's remaining descent distance 
; in a short string that can be broadcast on Twitter. 
; When the descent is over, the message should be "The rocket has landed!".
; Call your function rocket-descent-to-msg.
