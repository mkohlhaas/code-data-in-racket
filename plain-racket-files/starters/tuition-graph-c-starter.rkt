;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; Complete problem (C) from the reference rule videos.
; 
; "Design a function that consumes information about schools and produces 
; the school with the lowest international student tuition."
; 
; The function should consume a ListOfSchool. Call it cheapest.
; 
; ;; ASSUME the list includes at least one school or else
; ;;        the notion of cheapest doesn't make sense
; 
; Also note that the template for a function that consumes a non-empty 
; list is:
; 
; (define (fn-for-nelox nelox)
;   (cond [(empty? (rest nelox)) (...  (first nelox))] 
;         [else
;           (... (first nelox) 
;                (fn-for-nelox (rest nelox)))]))
; 
; And the template for a function that consumes two schools is: 
; 
; (define (fn... s1 s2)
; (... (school-name s1)
;      (school-tuition s1)
;      (school-name s2)
;      (school-tuition s2)))
; 



; 
; PROBLEM B:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a ListOfSchool and produces a list of the 
; school names. Call it get-names.
; 
;  Do you need to define a new helper function?
;
