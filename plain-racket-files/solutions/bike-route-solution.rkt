;; bike-route-solution.rkt

; PROBLEM a:
; 
; Suppose you are developing a route planning tool for bicycling in Vancouver.
; There are four varieties of designated bike routes:
; 
; 1) Separated Bikeway
; 2) Local Street Bikeway
; 3) Painted Bike Lane
; 4) Painted Shared-Use Lane
; 
; Use the HtDD recipe to design a data definition for varieties of bike routes (call it BikeRoute)


;; BikeRoute is one of:
;; - "Separated Bikeway"
;; - "Local Street Bikeway"
;; - "Painted Bike Lane"
;; - "Painted Shared-Use Lane"
;; interp.  Varieties of bike routes in Vancouver
;; <examples are redundant for enumerations>

#;
(define (fn-for-bike-route b)
  (cond [(string=? "Separated Bikeway" b)       (...)]
        [(string=? "Local Street Bikeway" b)    (...)]
        [(string=? "Painted Bike Lane" b)       (...)]
        [(string=? "Painted Shared-Use Lane" b) (...)]))

;; Template Rules Used:
;; - one of: 4 cases
;; - atomic distinct: "Separated Bikeway"
;; - atomic distinct: "Local Street Bikeway"
;; - atomic distinct: "Painted Bike Lane"
;; - atomic distinct: "Painted Shared-Use Lane" 

; PROBLEM b:
; 
; Separated bikeways and painted bike lanes are exclusively designated for bicycles, while
; local street bikeways and shared-use lanes must be shared with cars and/or pedestrians.
; 
; Design a function called 'exclusive?' that takes a bike route and indicates whether it 
; is exclusively designated for bicycles.


;; BikeRoute -> Boolean
;; indicate whether a bike route is exclusively designated for bicycles
(check-expect (exclusive? "Separated Bikeway") true)
(check-expect (exclusive? "Local Street Bikeway") false)
(check-expect (exclusive? "Painted Bike Lane") true)
(check-expect (exclusive? "Painted Shared-Use Lane") false)

#;
(define (exclusive? b) true) ; stub

;; <Template from BikeRoute>

(define (exclusive? b)
  (cond [(string=? "Separated Bikeway" b)       true]
        [(string=? "Local Street Bikeway" b)    false]
        [(string=? "Painted Bike Lane" b)       true]
