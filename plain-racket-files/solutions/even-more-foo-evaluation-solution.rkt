; PROBLEM:
; 
; Given the following function definition:
; 
; (define (farfle s)
;   (string-append s s))
; 
; Write out the step-by-step evaluation of the expression: 
; 
; (farfle (substring "abcdef" 0 2))
; 
; Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step.
; 



(farfle (substring "abcdef" 0 2))

(farfle "ab")

(string-append "ab" "ab")

"abab"
