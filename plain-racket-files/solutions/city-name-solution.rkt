; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Imagine that you are designing a program that, among other things, 
; has information about the names of cities in its problem domain.
; 
; Design a data definition to represent the name of a city. 
;    


;; Data definitions:

;; CityName is String
;; interp. the name of a city
(define CN1 "Boston")
(define CN2 "Vancouver")
#;
(define (fn-for-city-name cn)
  (... cn))

;; Template rules used:              For the first part of the course
;;   - atomic non-distinct: String     we want you to list the template
;;                                   rules used after each template.
