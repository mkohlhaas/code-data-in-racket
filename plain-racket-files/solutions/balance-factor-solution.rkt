; PROBLEM:
; 
; As discussed in lecture, for optimal lookup time we want a BST to be balanced. 
; The oldest approach to this is called AVL self-balancing trees and was invented in 1962. 
; The remainder of this problem set is based on AVL trees.
; 
; An individual node is balanced when the height of its left and right branches differ 
; by no more than 1. A tree is balanced when all its nodes are balanced.
; 
; a) Design the function balance-factor that consumes a node and produces its balance factor,
; which is defined as the height of its left child minus the height of its right child.
; 
; b) Use your function in part a) to design the function balanced?, which consumes a BST and 
; produces true if the tree is balanced.
; 
; Once you have the function, use it to compare what happens with the following two sequences
; of insertions:
; 
; 
; (insert 4 "a" 
;         (insert 5 "a"
;                 (insert 6 "a" 
;                         (insert 7 "a" 
;                                 (insert 8 "a" false)))))
;         
;         
; (insert 4 "a" 
;         (insert 5 "a"
;                 (insert 8 "a" 
;                         (insert 7 "a" 
;                                 (insert 6 "a" false)))))
