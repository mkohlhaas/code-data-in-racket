; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a world program as follows:
; 
; The world starts off with a piece of grass waiting to grow. As time passes, 
; the grass grows upwards. Pressing any key cuts the current strand of 
; grass to 0, allowing a new piece to grow to the right of it.
; 
; Starting display:
; 
; .
; 
; After a few seconds:
; 
; .
; 
; After a few more seconds:
; 
; .
; 
; Immediately after pressing any key:
; 
; .
; 
; A few more seconds after pressing any key:
; 
; .
; 
; NOTE 1: Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
