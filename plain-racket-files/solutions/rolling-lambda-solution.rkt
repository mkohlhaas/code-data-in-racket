; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a world program as follows:
; 
; The world starts off with a lambda on the left hand side of the screen. As 
; time passes, the lambda will roll towards the right hand side of the screen. 
; Clicking the mouse changes the direction the lambda is rolling (ie from 
; left -> right to right -> left). If the lambda hits the side of the window 
; it should also change direction.
; 
; Starting display (rolling to the right):
; 
; .
; 
; After a few seconds (rolling to the right):
;       .
; After a few more seconds (rolling to the right):
;                .
; A few seconds after clicking the mouse (rolling to the left):
; 
;      .
; 
; NOTE 1: Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
; 
; NOTE 2: DO THIS PROBLEM IN STAGES.
; 
; FIRST
; 
; Just make the lambda slide back and forth across the screen without rolling.
;       
; SECOND
;   
; Make the lambda spin as it slides, but don't worry about making the spinning
; be just exactly right to make it look like its rolling. Just have it 
; spinning and sliding back and forth across the screen.
; 
; FINALLY
; 
; Work out the math you need to in order to make the lambda look like it is
; actually rolling.  Remember that the circumference of a circle is 2*pi*radius,
; so that for each degree of rotation the circle needs to move:
; 
;    2*pi*radius
;    -----------
;        360
; 
; Also note that the rotate function requires an angle in degrees as its 
; first argument. [By that it means Number[0, 360). As time goes by the lambda
; may end up spinning more than once, for example, you may get to a point 
; where it has spun 362 degrees, which rotate won't accept. One solution to 
; that is to  use the modulo function as follows:
; 
; (rotate (modulo ... 360) LAMBDA)
; 
; where ... can be an expression that produces any positive number of degrees 
; and remainder will produce a number in [0, 360).
; 
; Remember that you can lookup the documentation of modulo if you need to know 
; more about it.
