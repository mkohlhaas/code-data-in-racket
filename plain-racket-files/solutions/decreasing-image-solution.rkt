;  PROBLEM:
;  
;  Design a function called decreasing-image that consumes a natural n and produces an image of all the numbers 
;  from n to 0 side by side. 
;  
;  So (decreasing-image 3) should produce .


(define TEXT-SIZE 20)
(define TEXT-COLOR "black")
(define SPACING (text " " TEXT-SIZE TEXT-COLOR))

;; Natural -> Image
;; produce an image of n, n-1, ... 0 side by side
