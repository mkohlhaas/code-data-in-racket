; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes an image, 
; and appears to put a box around it. Note that you can do this by creating an "outline" 
; rectangle that is bigger than the image, and then using overlay to put it on top of the image. 
; For example:
; 
; (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) should produce .
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
; 


;; Image -> Image
;; Puts a box around given image. Box is 2 pixels wider and taller than given image.
;; NOTE: A solution that follows the recipe but makes the box the same width and height 
;;       is also good. It just doesn't look quite as nice.

(check-expect (boxify (star 40 "solid" "gray")) 
              (overlay (rectangle 67 64 "outline" "black")
