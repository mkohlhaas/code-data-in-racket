;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; Design a data definition to help travellers plan their next trip. 
; A trip should specify an origin, destination, mode of transport and 
; duration (in days).
; 


(define-struct trip (origin destination mot duration))
;; Trip is (make-trip String String String Natural)
;; interp. a trip with origin, destination, mode of transport, and duration in days

(define T1 (make-trip "Vancouver" "Cancun" "Flight" 10))
(define T2 (make-trip "Calgary" "Ottawa" "Car" 14))
(define T3 (make-trip "Montreal" "New York" "Flight" 5))

;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM B:
; 
; You have just found out that you have to use all your days off work 
; on your next vacation before they expire at the end of the year. 
; Comparing two options for a trip, you want to take the one that 
; lasts the longest. Design a function that compares two trips and 
; returns the trip with the longest duration.
; 
; Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two 
; compound data parameters is for the template to include all 
; the selectors for both parameters.
; 


;; Trip Trip -> Trip
;; produce the trip with the longer duration, if durations are equal produce the second trip
