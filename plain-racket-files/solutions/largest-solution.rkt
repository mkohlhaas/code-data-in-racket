;; Data definitions:

; 
; Remember the data definition for a list of numbers we designed in Lecture 5f:
; (if this data definition does not look familiar, please review the lecture)
; 


;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. a list of numbers
(define LON1 empty)

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases

;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a list of numbers and produces the largest number 
; in the list. You may assume that all numbers in the list are greater than 0. If
; the list is empty, produce 0.
; 


;; ListOfNumber -> Number
;; produce the largest number in the given list, or 0 if empty
;; ASSUMES that every element of lon is > 0
(check-expect (largest empty) 0)
(check-expect (largest LON2) 60)
(check-expect (largest (cons 10 (cons 20 (cons 50 empty)))) 50)

;(define (largest lon) 0) ;stub
;<template from ListOfNumber>

(define (largest lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (if (> (first lon) (largest (rest lon)))
             (first lon)
             (largest (rest lon)))]))
